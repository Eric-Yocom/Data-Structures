4. This algorithm is of complexity class O(N), because it is a loop that runs N times where
N is equal to the length of the array passed to the method. It performs 2 operations inside
the loop so it's actually O(2N), but the important note is that it's running linearly.

5. This algorithm is also linear, and for the same reason. O(N).

6. This algorithm is O(N^2). The operations within the loop (remove/add) are O(N), and these 
operations run N times.

7. This algorithm is also O(N). The operations .get and .set only run once per call, and are only
called for each iteration of the loop.
